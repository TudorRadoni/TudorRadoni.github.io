   This is a project I've made in a really really big hurry when I was in the 12th grade at highschool. It's a game about philosophy, and it's in Romanian. I've made it in Unity and it's a 3D game. It's not that good tbh, but it's the first ever "finished" game I've made. To this day I keep making games in my free time, and I'm really proud of how far I've come. (Now I use Unreal Engine)

## About

This is a project I've made in a really really big hurry when I was in the 12th grade at highschool. It's a game about philosophy, and it's in Romanian. I've made it in Unity and it's a 3D game. It's not really good, but it's a good memory tbh.

The subject of the game is Friedrich Nietzsche's book, *Beyond Good and Evil*. As a result, the game should have been called *Beyond Good and Evil*, but, as previously stated, I was pressed for time and I scrapped an old project I had made prior to this one, hence the name of the game - *Whatever*.
