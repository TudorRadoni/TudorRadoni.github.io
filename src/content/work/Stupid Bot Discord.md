This is my first Discord bot and it's fairly stupid. 😁
As of now, it is nothing more than programming practice...

## Main features

- *Self-Generating* help menu
- fun commands, such as `howfat`
- it can even do math (whoa!)
- not-to-poorly-written code
- lots of stupidity, as the bot's name suggests

## Usage

Before compiling, rename `Modules/APIKeys.cs.template` to `Modules/APIKeys.cs` and fill in your Discord token.

You are free to do whatever you please with the **Stupid Bot**!

- 📚 Use is as a template to build other bots;
- 🎆 Modify it to oblivion;
- 💥 Make it crash;
- 🚪 Find vulnerabilities within its few lines of code;
- 🤖 Beep Boop it!
