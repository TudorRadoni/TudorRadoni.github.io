  The Keylogger is a project I have made for fun. It consists of the main keylogger, which is written in C++, and an interpreter, which is written in Python. The interpreter is used to read the logs and display them in a more readable format.

*Developed with C++ and Win32 API for Learning Purposes*

Explore the basics of programming and cybersecurity through this educational Keylogger project. Written in C++ using the Win32 API, it provides a hands-on experience without any email transmissionâ€”logs are simply saved locally on the desktop (in the stealthy `log.log` file haha).

## Features

- **C++ and Win32 API:** Built with C++ and the Win32 API, showcasing low-level programming skills.
- **Educational Focus:** Designed exclusively for learning, enabling users to understand keylogger development in a controlled environment.
- **Local Logging:** Prioritizing privacy and ethical use, logs are stored locally for a secure and responsible learning experience.
