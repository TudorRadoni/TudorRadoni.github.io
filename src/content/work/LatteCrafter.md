  One of my passions is making latte art and documenting it through photos and videos. Therefore, I created a coffee canvas where I can share my creations with the world. ☕

## How it started

My passion for ☕started in 2020, when I saw a perfect espresso shot beautifully flow through a bottomless portafilter. I couldn't help but think *"Hey, coffee was black last time I checked, not this gorgeous golden-chocolatey brown! I definitely got to try that!"*. And so I did. I bought a Gaggia Classic Pro (so I can mod it, of course!) and started my journey into the world of coffee.

## How it's going

Every evening I think about how awesome the morning will be, when I'll get back to making a cup of coffee. What does this mean? Well, yeah, I still love it and I'm always keen to learn more and more. Each day I try to improve my existing designs and seek new ones. I'm also trying to improve my photography and video skills, so I can share my creations with the world.

## Equipment

### Gaggia Classic Pro

It is said that the espresso machine doesn't matter as long as the grinder is good. I agree with that, but I also think that the espresso machine is the one that makes the coffee, so it's important to have a good one. I'm currently using a **Gaggia Classic Pro**, which I'm looking forward to mod with a PID, a pressure gauge and a some more basic accessories (like shower screen, low profile drip tray, etc.).

### Timemore Chestnut C3

I'm using a **Timemore Chestnut C3** hand grinder, which is a great entry-level grinder. It's not that great for espresso, since it has a step adjustment system, but it's definitely good enough for me. I'm planning to upgrade to o a fancier grinder in the future, but I'm not in a hurry.

### Accessories

As far as accessories go, I use basic stuff that does the job and is not too expensive.

- 58.35mm tamper (with a classy wooden handle 🪵)
- 350ml milk pitcher 🥛
- Handmade DIY WDT tool (made from needles and a cork 💉)
- Basic tamping mat ⬛
- Knock box (made from a ground coffee container 🗑️)

### Plans in the future

- Mod my espresso machine as mentioned above 🛠️
- Extend lattecrafter on other platforms (YouTube, TikTok, etc.) 📹
- Upgrade the quality of my photos and videos 📷
