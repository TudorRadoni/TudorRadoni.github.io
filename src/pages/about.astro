				<div class="content">
					<p>
						In the course of 1.5 months, with the help of skilled mentors and a passionate team,
						I have built a product from the ground up and went through the following stages:
						circuit implementation on breadboard and testing in simulation (LTSpice and Falstad),
						schematic and PCB layout design, HDL (Verilog) on Zynq Zybo Z7, Linux kernel drivers in C,
						high-level IIO applications using C and Python.

				<div class="content">
					<p><strong>Technical University of Cluj-Napoca</strong><br>
					<em>2020 - Present | Cluj-Napoca, Cluj, Romania</em><br>
					I am currently studying <strong>Automation & System Engineering</strong>
					at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. Focused on the practical aspects
					of leveraging technology for efficient systems.</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>I. C. Brătianu Hațeg National College</strong><br>
					<em>2016 - 2020 | Hațeg, Hunedoara, Romania</em><br>
					High school years at I. C. Brătianu Hațeg National College were dedicated to the
					<strong>Mathematics-Informatics Class</strong>. This period laid the groundwork
					for analytical thinking and a solid grasp of mathematics, physics and programming,
					providing a foundation for my current studies.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Skills</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p><strong>Win32 API</strong><br>
					I have built a few Windows apps (with C++) using this API and got to like it.
					I feel like it is simple enough to quickly make a program,
					but also complex enough to enable flexibility. 💻</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Terminal Fan</strong><br>
					Knowing how to type a few command is, surely, not much, but being able to write
					🐚 scripts and use command line tools makes things so easy sometimes.</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Photography</strong><br>
					Ever since I was a kid, 📸 was something that fascinated me.
					I always used to take pictures of everything, from the most
					epic sunset to the most basic coffee cup. Nothing's changed!</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Coffee</strong><br>
					My passion for ☕started in 2020, when I saw a perfect espresso shot
					beautifully flow into the most amazing latte art.
					I knew I had to try latte art, so here we are: @lattecrafter</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Music</strong><br>
					When I was little, I would knock on things (as knocking at a door) to see what
					sounds they make. Later, I discovered the 🎹 and then
					the 🎸and then fell in love with music! Later, I got into 🎛️ DJing. </p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Gaming (very badly)</strong><br>
					I once saw my dad playing a game and I wanted to try.
					I couldn't let go of the 🎮 ever since. One would say I must be pretty good,
					but, in reality, I straight up suck at video games 😅</p>
